# Real-time-offside-detection-using-single-camera
The objective of this report is to detail the implementation of offside detection using a single camera, specifically the broadcast camera commonly used in soccer matches. This project leverages various image processing techniques, including segmentation, line detection, and 3D-to-2D space interpretation, to achieve accurate offside detection.
